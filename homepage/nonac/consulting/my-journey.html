My Academic Journey

<p>I, like many of you, come from a diverse background. Hailing from India, I completed my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering at SVNIT Surat, an institution of national importance. Following this, I pursued my passion for physics by earning a Master's degree at Sorbonne (UPMC) in Paris, a renowned institution in the field. My academic journey took me further to the PSL Paris Observatory, where I honed my research skills in the dynamic environment of Paris.

PhD in Astrophysics and Gravitational Waves

<p>The pinnacle of my academic journey was achieved through a successful PhD application to the University of Glasgow in Astrophysics, with a particular focus on Gravitational Waves. It's worth noting that gaining admission into competitive PhD programs in STEM fields is no small feat. My journey was characterized by rigorous selection processes, and I am well aware of the challenges you might face.

Scholarships and International Experience

<p>Throughout my academic path, I was fortunate to receive prestigious scholarships, including <a href="https://ipi-sorbonne-universite.fr/ipiasmus/" style="color: white;">IPIASMUS</a>, ERASMUS, and a scholarship from the University of Glasgow. My experiences extend beyond borders, as I have had the opportunity to work at the Max Planck Institute on multiple occasions. This international exposure has enriched my academic and research skills, and I am eager to share the invaluable insights gained during my time abroad.</p>
