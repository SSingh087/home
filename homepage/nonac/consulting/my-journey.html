<p>I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/" style="color:white;">University of Glasgow</a> specializing in Astrophysics, focusing on Gravitational Waves. However, <a href="../../timeline/index.html" style="color: white;">this journey</a> didn't begin as smoothly as it sounds. I come from a vastly different background. Initially, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.svnit.ac.in/" style="color:white;">SVNIT Surat</a> in India, but my passion was always in Astrophysics. My determination to pursue this goal led me down a challenging path, eventually culminating in a decision to <a href="https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/13/so-you-want-to-learn-physics" style="color:white">self-teach</a> undergraduate Physics courses. With some guidance and a lot of strategic efforts, I overcame my first hurdle by securing a master's position at <a href="https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en" style="color:white;">Sorbonne (UPMC) University</a>, Paris, France<sup><a href="https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/news/2022-shanghai-rankings-sorbonne-university-top-10-worldwide-academic-subject" style="color:white;">1</a></sup>. I went on to complete master's degree in Astrophysics from <a href="https://www.observatoiredeparis.psl.eu/-observatoire-de-paris-.html?lang=en" style="color:white;">PSL Paris Observatory</a><sup><a href="https://psl.eu/en/university/psl-international-rankings" style="color:white;">2</a></sup>.

<p>Gaining admission into competitive programs, especially in STEM fields, is no small feat. Rigorous selection processes marked my journey - either being a master's application or a Ph.D.; hence, I am familiar with the challenges you may encounter. I've faced my fair share of setbacks at every stage of the application process. It's essential to recognize that these moments of disappointment, though discouraging at the time, ultimately strengthened my applications and, when adequately honed, led to success.</p>

<p>During my academic journey, I was fortunate to receive prestigious scholarships, including <a href="https://ipi-sorbonne-universite.fr/ipiasmus/" style="color: white;">IPIASMUS</a> and <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/education/set-projects-education-and-training/erasmus-funding-programme_en" style="color: white;">ERASMUS+</a>, and a secured funding for PhD. I had the opportunity to collaborate with brilliant minds and wonderful people, securing some of the most competitive positions throughout my academic career. The <a href="../../timeline/index.html" style="color: white;">diverse experiences</a> I've gained will be a significant advantage as you pursue your goal.</p>
