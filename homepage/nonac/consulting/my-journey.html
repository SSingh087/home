<p>Like many of you, I come from a diverse background. Hailing from India, I completed my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.svnit.ac.in/" style="color:white;">SVNIT Surat</a>. Following this, I pursued my passion for Physics by earning a Master's degree at <a href="https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en" style="color:white;">Sorbonne (UPMC) University</a> in Paris <sup><a href="https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/news/2022-shanghai-rankings-sorbonne-university-top-10-worldwide-academic-subject" style="color:white;">1</a></sup>.  Thereon I completed Master in Astrophysics from <a href="https://www.observatoiredeparis.psl.eu/-observatoire-de-paris-.html?lang=en" style="color:white;">PSL Paris Observatory</a> <sup><a href="https://psl.eu/en/university/psl-international-rankings" style="color:white;">2</a></sup>.

<p>Currently I am pursuing PhD from <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/" style="color:white;">University of Glasgow</a> in Astrophysics, with a particular focus on Gravitational Waves. Gaining admission into competitive PhD programs in STEM fields is no small feat, and my own journey was marked by demanding selection processes. I am well acquainted with the challenges you may encounter, having experienced my fair share of setbacks at every stage of the application process. It's important to recognize that these moments of disappointment, while discouraging at the time, have ultimately strengthened my applications and, when properly honed, led to success.

<p>Along my academic path, I was fortunate to be the recipient of prestigious scholarships, including <a href="https://ipi-sorbonne-universite.fr/ipiasmus/" style="color: white;">IPIASMUS</a> and <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/education/set-projects-education-and-training/erasmus-funding-programme_en" style="color: white;">ERASMUS+</a>, and a secured funding for PhD. I had the opporunity to work with great minds and wonderful people and secure some of the competetive positions throughout academic carrer. I believe that the <a href="../../timeline/index.html" style="color: white;">diverse experiences</a> I've gained will be a significant advantage as you pursue your own academic and research goals in graduate school.</p>
